     * Reflection Two
     *
     * How is a one-dimensional different from a two-dimensional one?
     *  - it potentially has an array as an element
     *
     * What does the values in an Array default too?
     *  - 0
     * How do one set the values in an Array?
     *  - to set a value in an array you need the index or the position and then set the value of the element at that position
     *
     * What are the rules for the index values of an Array?
     *  - it starts at index 0 up to the length minus one
     * What will happen if you use an index larger than the lenght of an array?
     *  - A RuntimeException will be thrown ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
     *
     * What condition do you need to use in a for loop to safe loop through the Array.
     *  - if(index < array.length){} - while the index is less than the length of the array we looping through
     *
     * Can you loop over an array using an enhanced for loop?
     *  - Yes, You can use it whenever you need to loop through all the elements of an array and don't need to know their index and don't need to change their values.
